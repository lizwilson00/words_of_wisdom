I once got off trail while climbing a 14er.  I was 100% convinced that I was descending the same way I had ascended. But it turns out that I had descended down the complete wrong ridge and there were cliffs in the direction that I now needed to go.  It was getting colder and I was running out of water.  It could be a very cold night ahead of me.  I held back the tears as I forced myself to take several deep breaths.  I sat down on a nearby rock, got out the compass and topo map and tried again to orient myself.  Worse comes to worse I ascend all the way to the top and start the descent anew.  I was about 2000 feet below the summit so that would take about 2 hours.  I didn't have a ton of time until the sun set.  I did have a headlamp but it was going to drop into the 30s and I didn't have a bivy or my down jacket.  I have to figure this out, I have to solve this problem.  There is no one around.  Not a soul.  I don't think I've ever been more scared in my life.  I stared at my compass and map.  If I followed this line I should hit a trail.
